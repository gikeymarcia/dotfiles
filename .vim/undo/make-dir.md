# necessary directory

my `$HOME/.vimrc` uses this location as the storage for undo files. Instead of making a script to create this directory I simply put this readme into my dotfile repo so it'll automatically create the folder without me thinking about it.

Sometimes the line between laziness and genius is thin.
